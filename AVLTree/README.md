**AVL Tree** [Download](https://github.com/ablochha/Resume/blob/master/AVLTree/AVLTree.zip?raw=true)

2nd year individual assignment, written in Java.

The purpose of this program was to gain experience implementing the AVL Tree data structure. We were given the interface for the AVL Tree, the AVL Node, and the file reader. We implemented the AVL Tree by following pseudocode, and we wrote a small program that would read words from a file and fill the AVL Tree data strucutre. We then sorted the words by frequency, and the output consists of the top 'k' frequency words that are not considered common.

After downloading `FindKeyWords.jar`, `DostoevskyIdiot.txt`, and `MostFrequentEnglishWords.txt`, run with

```
java -jar FindKeyWords.jar 500 DostoevskyIdiot.txt MostFrequentEnglishWords.txt
```
