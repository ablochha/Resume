3rd year individual assignment, written in C++.

This program is a banking system.

With the provided `data.dat`, you can log in using `Client`, `Manager`, and `Maintenance` to experience the bank from various perspectives. Client's can do normal transactions like depositing and withdrawing money. Manager's can view client details and bank details. Maintenance users can turn on execution trace, which outputs to `maintenance.txt` every time a user navigates the bank menus. You can always add a new login ID and choose a role from the main menu.

After downloading `main.cpp`, `data.dat`, and `maintenance.txt`, compile and run with 

```
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```
