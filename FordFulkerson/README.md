**FordFulkerson**

4th year individual assignment, written in Java.

This project was an experimental evaluation of different algorithms for computing maximum flow in a flow network. The algorithm of Ford and Fulkerson with varying strategies for choosing the augmenting path were compared. The path with the largest residual capacity, the path with the smallest bottleneck, and an arbitrary path were used in the experiment. Maximum flow was computed the quickest and with the least number of iterations while choosing the augmenting path with the largest residual capacity.
