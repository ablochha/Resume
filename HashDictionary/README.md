2nd year individual assignment, written in Java.

This program attempts to spellcheck an input text file against a dictionary text file. The hashtable implementation is compared against a linkedlist implementation to show the hashtable's performance.

After downloading `Spell.jar`, `dictionary.txt`, and `d1.txt`, run with

```
java -jar Spell.jar dictionary.txt d1.txt
```
