# Highlights

**Networking**
(3rd year individual project, written in C)

This program consists of a client, a metadata server, and a file transfer server. The client will let a user upload files to the file transfer server. The metadata server will authenticate the client's credentials (using TCP) and manage the metadata of the database. The file transfer server will receive and store transferred files (using UDP). Redis is used as the database.
