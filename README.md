# Highlights

**Networking**
(3rd year individual project)

This program consists of a client, a metadata server, and a file transfer server. The client will let a user upload files to the file transfer server. The metadata server will authenticate the client's credentials (using TCP) and manage the metadata of the database. The file transfer server will receive and store transferred files (using UDP). Redis is used as the database. Includes binaries to run the program.

**Group Project**
(2nd year team project) 

This program displays the current, the short term, and the long term weather for a selected location. Includes a runnable .jar file.
